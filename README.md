# Dotfiles

Forked from [Ehren Murdick's Config](https://github.com/ehrenmurdick/config). 

OSX defaults learnt from [Mathais Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) as forked by [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles).

## OS Specific

### Mac OS X

For setting up some sensible defaults and removal of some annoyances from Mac OS run `setup/osx`. 

To install some pretty vital Mac OS utilities, run `setup/brew` which requires [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) to be installed.

## Todo

- Ensure this works cross platform - currently heavily skewed to Mac development machines.
