# Dotfiles

Forked from [Ehren Murdick's Config](https://github.com/ehrenmurdick/config). 

OSX defaults learnt from [Mathais Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) as forked by [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles).

## OS Specific

### Mac OS X

Essential Mac OS X utilties are managed with [Brewdler](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-brewdler). Assuming Homebrew is successfully installed all you need to do is.

```
$ ./install.sh
```

That's it. 

This also sets up a huge number of sensible Mac OS X defaults which can be seen in the file `setup/osx`.

## Todo

- Keyboard repeat is not quite fast enough - perhaps they have changed the Mac OS X API?
- Ensure this works cross platform - currently heavily skewed to Mac development machines.
